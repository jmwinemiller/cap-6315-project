### CAP 6315 Project Part #1 – Social Network EDA
This term-long project will guide you through the full big data pipeline 
using one real-world large dataset. You will work with the same dataset 
both project parts.

#### Project Part #1 Learning Objectives:
- Students will be able to use NetworkX library to create and visualize social networks, as well as extract meaningful metrics from it.
- Students will learn to interpret the results of social network analysis by using network properties such as network diameter, edge density, and clustering coefficient.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on node-level attributes using descriptive statistics and visualizations.
- Communicate insights from social network and attribute-based analysis using clear visualizations and written interpretations.
- Compute and interpret multiple centrality and influence measures in social networks.
- Apply and compare community detection algorithms.
